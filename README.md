I've studied programming for 22 years since 1998. For the long time, I've developed many programs and also have enjoyed lots of chances that can enhance my abilities dramatically. Therefore, I say with confident, "I am one of the best programmers in my home country, the South Korea."

In nowadays, I am developing open source projects. Working in a company, if I feel a new feature is required or find some ordinary feature is not enough, then I develop an open source component at night or weekend. When such private developments are accumulated and they're following a paradigm or pattern, they would be re-generated to a new open source project, as you can see from the below.
